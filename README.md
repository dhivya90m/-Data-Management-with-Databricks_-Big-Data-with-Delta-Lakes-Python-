# Data-Management-with-Databricks Big-Data-with-Delta-Lakes(Python)

Project Scenario: For an online clothing brand that sells a wide range of fashion Brands. The company's Supply Chain team has been tasked with building a dashboard to Analyze Orders history.
The supply chain team has been tasked with building a dashboard to Analyze Orders history. This dashboard will be used to inform purchasing behaviour and ensure that the company has enough inventory to meet demand for the upcoming holiday season.
Throughout this real-world business scenario, I have learnt how to create and ingest data into a delta table. Then use Databricks notebooks (using Python and SQL) to process/transform the data and produce the Supply chain dashboard. At I have leveraged to Delta Lake's built-in functionalities such as merge operations and time travel to create a scalable data pipeline.
